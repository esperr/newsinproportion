# newsinproportion
News in Proportion is an experiment in data visualization that allows you to explore just what made news in the past in different parts of the country. Built on top of the rich data provided by Chronicling America, this tool maps your search and shows not only many times it appears in the digitized newspaper pages of a given state, but also how great a proportion of a state's news that number represents.

The geographical concentration of some searches, such as "lutefisk" or "tarpon", probably won't surprise you. Others, such as "anthrax", just might.

Once you have performed a couple of searches, you can toggle back and forth to compare them. You can even directly compare any two terms to see which is more prevalent in each state.
